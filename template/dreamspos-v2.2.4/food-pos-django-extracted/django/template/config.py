# ========================= Base URL Configuration =========================
# Set BASE_URL to the path prefix you want to host the app under.
# Example values:
#   '' or '/'      -> App served at domain root (e.g., https://example.com/)
#   '/pos'         -> App served under a subpath (e.g., https://example.com/pos)
# Change ONLY the value below to switch the base URL for the entire app.

# NOTE: Keep a trailing slash if you prefer (e.g., '/food-pos/template/');
# the middleware will normalize it for routing.
BASE_URL = '/food-pos/template/'
# BASE_URL = ''

# ========================= Debug Configuration =========================
# Set DEBUG to True for development (shows errors, auto-reload)
# Set DEBUG to False for production (hides errors, optimized)
DEBUG = True  # Change to False for production
